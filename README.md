# PythonUCLSimulator
A simulator for the UEFA Champion's League written in Python.

This is a work-in-progress passion project of mine over the course of the last few months.
Currently, the simulator is capable of:
 - To a basic level, simulating a match between two teams with different skill ratings
 - Generating a group stage for the Champion's League
 - Generating fixtures for each of these groups
 - Simulating each match in the group stage, and outputting each group as a table
 - Taking teams as input from a text file, with a variable name, and skill level

In the future, I am hoping to add the capability to:
 - Generate Round of 16 fixtures, Quarter Finals, Semi Finals, and the Finals
 - Simulating all of these matches, including capability to host two-legged matches to determine the winner
 - Displaying this all in a neat, presentable format
 - Simulate matches to a more complex degree than just a skill variable determining goals scored
